- 👋 Hi, I’m @JCorcelli
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write a pretty damn good novel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games or my developer tools.
- 📫 How to reach me, ActiveUnique@gmail.com

I set my other two repositories to private due to a lack of visible interest. In the future I'll be soloing game development and never sharing any insight with people of common interests.
